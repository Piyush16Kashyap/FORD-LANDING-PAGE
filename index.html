            The Ford Figo was unveiled in Delhi in September 2009. It is based
            on the same body used by the Fiesta Mk5 (B256) but with revised
            front and rear treatments. It is smaller than the Fiesta Classic
            which Ford also sells in India. The name "Figo" is a colloquial
            Italian word meaning "cool". It was launched to the Indian market in
            March 2010, and by July 2010 there were 25,000 sales bookings across
            all variants. A facelifted model of the Figo was launched on 15
            October 2012. This model has a larger hexagonal grill and redesigned
            head and tail lamps. It was released in South Africa in January
            2013.

            The Ford Fiesta sedan have also been stooped. The American automaker
            is taking these measures due to the poor sales figures of these
            cars. Fiesta have been selling in poor numbers since its launch and
            none of the measures by Ford.
